# CrisisApp

A cross-platform social impact mobile application connecting families in crisis with a global community of supporters.

## Mission

CrisisApp provides a platform for families facing humanitarian crises (war, displacement, climate disasters, political persecution) to share their stories and receive direct support from a compassionate global community. Through engaging social media-style content delivery, we bridge the gap between those in need and those who want to help.

## Overview

CrisisApp combines storytelling, social engagement, and fundraising to amplify the voices of crisis-affected families while making it easy for supporters to discover, connect with, and assist those in need.

### For Crisis Families

- Share their journey and current situation
- List specific needs and link to fundraising campaigns
- Connect directly with supporters (future feature)

### For Supporting Users
- Discover families through Instagram-style explore feed
- Engage with short-form video content (Reels-style endless scroll)
- Make small donations through integrated external platforms
- Share profiles to amplify reach on social media
- Earn points, levels, and recognition for contributions
- View leaderboards and earn badges for support activities

- **Emotional Connection**: Design for storytelling and authentic human connection
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into where support goes and impact metrics

### Technical Approach
- **Start Simple**: MVP focuses on core value proposition
- **External Dependencies**: Leverage proven platforms (GoFundMe) for trust and compliance
- **Scalable Foundation**: Architecture supports future feature expansion
- **Cross-Platform First**: Equal experience on iOS and Android
