# Claude Context - CrisisApp Project

## Project Overview

**CrisisApp** is a cross-platform React Native mobile application that connects families in humanitarian crises (war, displacement, climate disasters, political persecution) with a global community of supporters. The app combines storytelling, social engagement, and fundraising to amplify the voices of crisis-affected families.

### Mission
Provide a platform for crisis families to share their stories and receive direct support through a compassionate global community using engaging social media-style content delivery.

## Current Status: MVP Phase 2 - Real Content System Complete

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Navigation ✨ UPDATED
- **Expo Router** file-based routing (routes match file structure)
- **Root Layout** (`app/_layout.tsx`) - Central auth navigation controller
  - Manages all authentication-based redirects
  - Checks email verification status
  - Single source of truth for routing decisions
  - Shows loading screen while auth initializes
- **Tab Layout** (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`) - Protected tab navigation
  - Only renders if user is authenticated
  - Returns null for unauthenticated users (no navigation loops)
  - Bottom tabs with Home, Stories, Support, Notifications, Profile
- Dynamic routes use `[id]` syntax (e.g., `family/[id].tsx`)
- Sign in screen is the index route
- Email verification screen blocks access to tabs until verified

### Authentication Flow
1. App starts → Root layout initializes auth state
2. Checks Supabase session from AsyncStorage
3. If session exists → fetch user profile from PostgreSQL
4. Route user based on state:
   - No user → redirect to sign-in (`/`)
   - User but unverified → redirect to verify-email (`/verify-email`)
   - User and verified → allow access to tabs (`/(tabs)/home`)
5. Auth state changes trigger navigation automatically
6. onAuthStateChange listener keeps state synchronized

### Data Flow (Current MVP) ✨ UPDATED
1. **Authentication data** - Real Supabase Auth + PostgreSQL profiles
2. **Crisis families data** - Real Supabase PostgreSQL crisis_families table ✨ NEW
3. **Videos & images** - Real Supabase Storage (family-videos, family-images buckets) ✨ NEW
4. **Posts/donations data** - Still uses `data/mockData.ts` (home feed not yet connected)
5. **State management** - Zustand for auth state, React useState/useEffect for families data
6. **Data fetching** - familiesService.ts provides type-safe Supabase queries
7. Navigation uses `useRouter()` from expo-router
8. All family-related screens fetch real data from database

### User Types
- **Supporters**: Can view content, donate (external links), earn points/badges
- **Crisis Families**: Can create profiles, share stories (view-only in supporter perspective)
- Current implementation only shows supporter perspective

### External Dependencies
- **Fundraising**: Links to external platforms (GoFundMe, etc.) - no in-app payment processing
- **Videos**: Uploaded to Supabase Storage (manually via dashboard) ✨ UPDATED
- **Images**: Uploaded to Supabase Storage (manually via dashboard) ✨ UPDATED

## Crisis Families Content System ✨ NEW

### Overview
Crisis families are now stored in Supabase and fetched dynamically by the app. Videos and images are hosted in Supabase Storage buckets. This system is production-ready and supports real content for demos.

### Supabase Storage Buckets

#### family-videos bucket
- Stores video files (MP4 recommended)
- Public read access
- Authenticated write/update/delete
- Used by Support/Reels screen for vertical video scrolling

#### family-images bucket
- Stores profile and cover images (JPEG/PNG)
- Public read access
- Authenticated write/update/delete
- Used by Stories grid and family profile screens

### Data Service Layer (`lib/familiesService.ts`)

Provides type-safe functions for fetching family data:

#### `fetchAllFamilies(options?)`
- Fetches all crisis families from database
- Optional filters: limit, verified status, ordering
- Returns: `Promise<CrisisFamily[]>`
- Used by: Stories screen

#### `fetchFamilyById(id)`
- Fetches single family by UUID
- Returns: `Promise<CrisisFamily | null>`
- Used by: Family profile screen

#### `fetchFamiliesWithVideos(options?)`
- Fetches only families that have video_url
- Optional limit parameter
- Returns: `Promise<CrisisFamily[]>`
- Used by: Support/Reels screen

#### `searchFamilies(searchTerm)`
- Search families by name, location, or tags
- Returns: `Promise<CrisisFamily[]>`
- Used by: (Future search feature)

#### `getFamiliesCount(verified?)`
- Get total count of families
- Optional filter by verification status
- Returns: `Promise<number>`
- Used by: (Future analytics)

**Data Transformation:**
- Service layer transforms snake_case database fields to camelCase TypeScript
- Validates data against CrisisFamily interface
- Handles errors gracefully with console logging

### Screen Implementation

#### Stories Screen (`app/(tabs)/stories.tsx`)
- Fetches all families on mount using `fetchAllFamilies()`
- Displays in 2-column grid with FlatList
- Shows loading spinner during fetch
- Error state with retry button
- Empty state for no families
- Real-time data from database (no mock data)

#### Support/Reels Screen (`app/(tabs)/support.tsx`)
- Fetches families with videos using `fetchFamiliesWithVideos()`
- Displays in vertical scroll with video auto-play
- Loading/error/empty states
- Videos stream from Supabase Storage
- Full-screen TikTok/Reels style

#### Family Profile Screen (`app/family/[id].tsx`)
- Fetches single family by ID using `fetchFamilyById()`
- Shows loading spinner while fetching
- Error state if family not found
- Displays full profile with story, needs, fundraising progress
- "Donate Now" opens external fundraising link

### Content Upload Workflow

**For demo/testing purposes**, families are added manually via:

1. **Upload media to Supabase Storage** (via dashboard):
   - Navigate to Storage in Supabase dashboard
   - Upload videos to `family-videos` bucket
   - Upload images to `family-images` bucket
   - Copy public URLs for each file

2. **Create family data JSON**:
   - Use `scripts/example-family.json` as template
   - Fill in family details with Storage URLs
   - Include fundraising links (can be placeholder)

3. **Run helper script**:
   ```bash
   npm run add-family my-family.json
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   npx ts-node scripts/addFamily.ts my-family.json
   ```

4. **Verify in app**:
   - Reload app
   - Check Stories grid for new family
   - View video in Support/Reels
   - Tap to view full profile

**See `UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` for complete step-by-step instructions.**

### Helper Script (`scripts/addFamily.ts`)

Node.js/TypeScript script for easily adding families to database:

**Features:**
- Validates JSON structure before inserting
- Checks required fields (name, location, story, etc.)
- Validates needs array structure
- Inserts into Supabase crisis_families table
- Returns family ID and confirmation
- Shows helpful error messages

**Usage:**
```bash
# Show help and example JSON structure
npx ts-node scripts/addFamily.ts --help

# Add a family from JSON file
npx ts-node scripts/addFamily.ts path/to/family.json

# Or use npm script
npm run add-family family.json
```

**Requirements:**
- Environment variables set (EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
- Valid JSON file with all required fields
- ts-node and @types/node installed (dev dependencies)

### Database Migrations

#### Storage Setup (`supabase/storage-setup.sql`)
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to:
- Create `family-videos` and `family-images` buckets
- Set up public read access policies
- Allow authenticated users to upload/update/delete

#### Crisis Families Table (`supabase/crisis-families-migration.sql`)
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to:
- Create `crisis_families` table with full schema
- Set up RLS policies (public read, authenticated family write)
- Create indexes on created_at, verified, tags
- Add triggers for updated_at auto-update
- Add validation function for needs JSONB structure

### Navigation Protection

#### Root Layout (`app/_layout.tsx`)
- Initializes auth on app load
- Shows loading screen during initialization
- Routes users based on auth state:
  - Not authenticated → `/` (sign-in)
  - Authenticated but unverified → `/verify-email`
  - Authenticated and verified → `/(tabs)/home`
- Single source of truth for navigation
- Prevents navigation race conditions

#### Tab Layout (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`)
- Returns `null` if not authenticated (blocks rendering)
- Only shows tabs for verified users
- No redundant navigation logic
- Relies on root layout for redirects

## Mock Data Structure (Deprecated) ✨ UPDATED

Located in `data/mockData.ts`:

**Note:** Crisis families data is now deprecated in mock data. Families are fetched from Supabase database instead.

```typescript
// DEPRECATED: Crisis families (now fetched from Supabase)
// Previously had 50+ mock families - no longer used

// Posts for home feed (still mock):
- Family attribution
- Media (photo/video)
- Caption and hashtags
- Likes and shares count

// User profile stats (still mock):
- Stats (points, donations, level, streak)
- Badges (achievements)
- Donation history
- Recent posts
```

**What's Real vs Mock:**
- ✅ **Real**: Crisis families, videos, images (Supabase)
- ✅ **Real**: User authentication and profiles (Supabase)
- ❌ **Mock**: Posts for home feed (mockData.ts)
- ❌ **Mock**: User stats and badges (mockData.ts)
- ❌ **Mock**: Donation tracking (mockData.ts)

## Important Implementation Notes ✨ UPDATED

### Video Scroll Screen (`app/(tabs)/support.tsx`)
- Fetches families with videos from Supabase on mount
- Uses `FlatList` with `pagingEnabled` for vertical scroll
- Video auto-plays when in view (tracked by index)
- Videos stream from Supabase Storage buckets
- Overlays for actions (share, donate, like, comment)
- Family info at bottom with semi-transparent background
- Loading/error/empty states for better UX

### Family Profile Screen (`app/family/[id].tsx`)
- Accessed via dynamic route: `/family/[id]`
- Uses `useLocalSearchParams()` to get ID
- Fetches family from Supabase database by ID (not mock data)
- Shows loading spinner while fetching
- Error handling if family not found
- "Donate Now" opens external URL with `Linking.openURL()`

### Stories/Explore Screen (`app/(tabs)/stories.tsx`)
- Fetches all families from Supabase on mount
- 2-column grid layout with FlatList
- Loading/error/empty states
- Real-time data from database

### Navigation Flow ✨ UPDATED
```
_layout.tsx (Root - Auth Controller)
    │
    ├─→ Not authenticated
    │   └─→ index.tsx (Sign In/Sign Up)
    │       ├─→ Sign up success → verify-email.tsx
    │       └─→ Sign in success → check verification
    │
    ├─→ Authenticated but unverified email

        └─→ (tabs)/_layout.tsx (Tab Navigator)
            ├── home.tsx
            ├── stories.tsx → family/[id].tsx (tap family card)
            ├── support.tsx
            ├── notifications.tsx
            └── profile.tsx (shows real user data)
                └─→ Sign out → back to index.tsx
```

### Styling Approach
- All styles use StyleSheet.create()
- Colors: Primary blue (#0066FF), black buttons, gray backgrounds
- Follows wireframe designs closely
- Uses emoji icons temporarily (should be replaced with proper icon library)

- Always push to GitHub after committing

### Current Branch
- `main` - primary development branch

## Claude's Best Practices for This Project

### Before Making Changes
1. **Understand the request fully** - Ask clarifying questions if instructions are ambiguous
2. **Check existing code** - Read relevant files before editing to understand patterns
3. **Review wireframes** - User has Figma designs; reference them for UI work
4. **Consider MVP scope** - Focus on core functionality over polish

### While Coding
1. **Keep code clean and readable**
   - Use descriptive variable names
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Follow existing code style and patterns

2. **Maintain consistency**
   - Match styling approach (StyleSheet patterns)
   - Use same component structure across screens
   - Follow TypeScript types strictly

3. **Think ahead for integration**
   - Write code that can easily swap mock data for Supabase queries
   - Structure components to accept props from future state management
   - Keep business logic separate from UI

4. **Remove dead code**
   - Delete unused imports
   - Remove commented-out code
   - Clean up console.logs

### After Making Changes
1. **Test TypeScript compilation**: `npx tsc --noEmit`
2. **Stage and commit changes**: `git add -A && git commit`
3. **Push to GitHub**: `git push`
4. **Update documentation** if architecture changes

### When Stuck or Unclear
1. **Ask the user questions** - Better to clarify than guess
2. **Propose multiple approaches** - Let user choose direction
3. **Check documentation** - Refer to Expo/React Native docs
4. **Review existing code** - Look at similar implementations

## Common Tasks & How to Handle Them

### Adding a New Screen
1. Create file in appropriate location (`app/` or `app/(tabs)/`)
2. Fetch data from Supabase using service layer functions (e.g., `familiesService.ts`)
3. Follow existing screen structure (SafeAreaView, header, ScrollView)
4. Add loading/error/empty states for better UX
5. Add TypeScript types if new data structures needed
6. Update navigation in `_layout.tsx` if adding to tabs

### Adding Crisis Family Content
1. **Upload media**: Upload videos/images to Supabase Storage via dashboard
2. **Get URLs**: Copy public URLs for uploaded files
3. **Create JSON**: Use `scripts/example-family.json` as template
4. **Run script**: `npm run add-family your-family.json`
5. **Verify**: Reload app and check Stories/Reels screens
6. **See `UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions**

### Integrating Real Backend (DONE for Families) ✨
1. ✅ Supabase client created in `lib/supabase.ts`
2. ✅ Crisis families use Supabase queries via `familiesService.ts`
3. ✅ Loading states and error handling implemented
4. ✅ Authentication flow fully implemented
5. ✅ Environment variables configured
6. 🚧 Posts/donations still use mock data (future work)

### Styling Changes
1. Follow existing StyleSheet patterns
2. Use consistent colors (primary: #0066FF, black buttons)
3. Match spacing and sizing to wireframes
4. Test on both iOS and Android if possible

## User Workflow Expectations ✨ UPDATED

### Setup Flow (First Time)
1. Run database migrations in Supabase (see `supabase/` directory)
2. Upload videos and images to Supabase Storage
3. Add family profiles using helper script (see `UPLOAD_GUIDE.md`)
4. Run: `npm install` → `npm run ios`

### Testing Flow
The app should:
1. Open to Sign In screen
2. Require email verification for new accounts
3. Navigate to Home tab after verified sign-in
4. Fetch real crisis families from Supabase
5. Display families in Stories grid (if families exist in database)
6. Play real videos from Supabase Storage in Support/Reels screen
7. Allow tapping family cards to view full profiles
8. Show loading/error states during data fetching
9. Open external fundraising links when "Donate Now" is tapped

### Design Reference
User has Figma wireframes showing:
- Exact layout of each screen
- Button placements and text
- Grid layouts for family cards
- Video player UI with overlays
- Stats and profile sections

Match these as closely as possible.

## Next Development Phases

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Set up Supabase project
2. Implement real authentication
3. Create database schema
4. Replace mock data with real queries
